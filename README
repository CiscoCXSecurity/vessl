vessl - a shell wrapper to openssl which verifies ssl certificates

Usage: vessl -h host [-p port] [-c certfile] [-v]

By default the output will be 3 files:
	
	ip:port.verify
	ip:port.cert
	sslmap

The first is the verification data, the second is the certificate and the third maps IP to SSL Hostname 

The script requires a vaild PEM certificate repository which is by defailt looked for in /etc/certs/mozilla.pem

The PEM file can be created by extracting them from your browser of chioce. There is also a debain package and ebuild which contains them. Once the individual files are created they can just be cated together to create one large file.

== Gentoo ==

emerge ca-certificates
mkdir /etc/certs
cat /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /etc/certs/mozilla.pem
